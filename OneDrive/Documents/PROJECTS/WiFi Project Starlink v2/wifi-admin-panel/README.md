## Data Structure

### User Management
The User Management system tracks credit adjustments and user history in the `users` collection:

```javascript
{
  // ... existing user fields ...
  creditsMinutes: number,           // Current credit balance in minutes
  lastCreditAdjustment: {           // Last credit adjustment made by admin
    amount: number,                  // Amount adjusted (positive or negative)
    reason: string,                  // Reason for the adjustment
    timestamp: Timestamp,            // When the adjustment was made
    previousAmount: number,          // Previous credit balance
    newAmount: number               // New credit balance after adjustment
  }
}
```

### Support Tickets
The Support Ticketing System uses a Firestore collection called `supportTickets` with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  userId: string,           // User ID who created the ticket
  userEmail: string,        // User's email address
  subject: string,          // Ticket subject/title

    text: string,
    timestamp: Timestamp,
    isUser: boolean
  }
}
```

### Network Status
The Network Status Page reads from a Firestore collection called `networkStatus` with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  status: 'OPERATIONAL' | 'OUTAGE' | 'DEGRADED',
  downloadSpeed: number, // Mbps
  uploadSpeed: number,   // Mbps
  latency: number,       // ms
  packetLoss: number,    // percentage
  jitter: number         // ms
}
```

The Enhanced Notification System uses a Firestore collection called `notifications` with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  // Core fields
  type: string,                    // 'payment_submission' | 'support_ticket' | 'bulletin_post' | 'referral' | 'mention' | 'bulletin_announcement'
